**AxBench** is a benchmark suite for approximate computing. We develop **AxBench** aiming to provide a set of representative applications from various domains to explore different aspect of the approximate computing.

**AxBench** is developed by Amir Yazdanbakhsh in Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Hadi Esmaeilzadeh.


** Papers **

We actively work on **AxBench** to add more applications from different domains (e.g. Computer Vision, Data Analytics, Multimedia, Web Search, Finance, etc.). We will also be working on adding different features to this benchmark suite in order to enable researchers to study different aspects of approximate computing.  As a courtesy to the developers, we ask that you please cite our papers from MICRO'12 and ISCA'14 describing the suite:
